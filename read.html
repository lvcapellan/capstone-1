					<h1>4 Proven Approaches to Increase Your Confidence Level</h1>
					<h4 class="my-0">Stick with science-based therapies to improve your self-confidence.</h4>
					<small class="d-block text-muted">Posted by Barbara Markway Ph.D. on Oct 23, 2018</small>
					<img class="myread-image img-fluid float-left mt-3 mr-3" src="assets/images/article4.jpg" alt="Article 4 Image">
					<p>
						Have you ever said to yourself, “I don’t feel confident, so I couldn’t possibly… [insert desired goal here].” Not many of us are taught how confidence truly works. We get it backwards. We believe we have to wait until we feel confident before we can act confidently.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my new book, <em><strong>The Self-Confidence Workbook: A Guide to Overcoming Self-Doubt and Improving Self-Esteem</strong></em>, I show you the truth about self-confidence: what it is, where it come from, and how to master the rules of the confidence game. The book is based on evidence-based therapies, meaning they’ve been shown in rigorous research studies to work. Let’s look at each one and show how it relates to self-confidence. 
					</p>
					<h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
					<p>
						If you’ve read any self-help books or articles, you’ve likely heard of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), as it’s one of the most widely-used types of treatment for depression, anxiety, and many other conditions. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Here’s one principle of CBT in action. Imagine you’re walking down the street and you see someone on the other side walking toward you. You get a little closer and recognize the person as someone you know from your Zumba class. You look up, smile, wave and shout “hi.” The other person keeps walking and doesn’t acknowledge you. There are many ways you could interpret this situation. What would you say to yourself? 
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						A.	She must not like me. I’m such a loser.
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						B.	She must not have seen me.
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						C.	She’s so stuck up. I can’t believe she didn’t say hi.		
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, imagine how you’d feel in each case. 
					</p>				
					<p>
						If you thought to yourself, “She must not like me,” you’d likely feel sad, embarrassed, or something along those lines. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you thought to yourself, “She must not have seen me,” you’d likely feel pretty neutral, or maybe simply a little disappointed. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you answered C, you might feel angry.
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice that the event is the same. The only thing that has changed is your interpretation of the situation, or what you’re saying to yourself. The principle behind CBT is that self-talk matters.
					</p>
					<p>
						So what does this have to do with confidence? Low self-confidence is often based upon unhelpful or untrue interpretations of a situation. If you believe your Zumba classmate didn’t wave at you because you’re a loser, you’re much less likely to risk saying hi or starting a conversation with her in the future. That’s why CBT, a set of methods to identify such thoughts and reframe them, is often so useful in building self-assurance. 
					</p>
					<h3>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h3>
					<p>
						Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, pronounced like the word “act”) was developed in 1986 by Steven C. Hayes, a professor in the psychology department at the University of Nevada. Hayes took a somewhat controversial view, at least in terms of mainstream psychology at the time, asserting that suffering is an inevitable and essential part of being human. He argued that accepting this suffering, rather than running from it, was a more effective way to build a meaningful life.
					</p>
					<p>
						He also took a different view of thoughts than his CBT colleagues. Recall that in CBT you aim to notice your negative thoughts so that you can replace them with more helpful ones. ACT doesn’t place as much emphasis on the content of your thoughts. At the heart of ACT is the idea that you can learn to live with even unpleasant thoughts, as long as you don’t give them power over your actions. 
					</p>
					<p>
						ACT teaches you not to avoid worry, fear, or doubt, because negative feelings are just a natural part of life. Struggling against your anxiety can often make it worse.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you find yourself thinking, “I can’t do this,” or “This is going to be a disaster,” you can learn to notice the thought and let it pass you by without deciding it’s the gospel truth. Detaching from your negative thoughts helps prevent rumination, which is linked to anxiety and depression, and lessens the urge to run from discomfort by indulging in harmful behaviors such as binge-drinking or overeating.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may not be able to evict your inner critic from your mind, but you can learn to tune out its relentless negativity and move forward — or “act” — with confidence.
					</p>
					<h3>Exposure Therapy</h3>
					<p>
						Exposure therapy sometimes falls under the umbrella of CBT, as it is a behavioral therapy aimed at helping people overcome anxiety and fear. This type of therapy helps people identify thoughts and situations that trigger the most fear and then gently exposes sufferers to them. It’s been shown to help people overcome spider phobias to stage fright — and it can help you develop your confidence, too.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don’t worry — you don’t have to dive into the deep end and learn to swim! Research shows that being forced to face a big fear all at once only leaves you traumatized, swearing you’ll never try again. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Exposure therapy is more like dipping your toes in the water. You start with a tiny first step that scares you just a little bit, getting used to the fear and realizing you’re capable of handling it. Then you build up gradually to bigger and bigger steps, until you’re finally swimming in the pool.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some exposure therapy is done in real life. For example, I took a client who was afraid of heights to a nearby building for several sessions, working our way up the floors until she was comfortable standing close to a railing many stories up. Other times, imagining the situation is enough to practice grappling with the fear.
					</p>
					<p>
						The key is repetition: you can’t try facing your fear once and then wait a year and try again. Here’s an example of how Kurt, who feels he doesn’t have the confidence to attend networking events in his industry, might use exposure therapy to overcome that fear.
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						Week 1: Go to a networking event with someone he already knows and stay just 30 minutes.
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						Week 2: Go to an event with someone he knows and introduce himself to at least one new person.	
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						Week 3: Go to an event with someone he knows and introduce himself to three new people.
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						Week 4: Go to an event by himself, greet everyone he’s met before, and introduce himself to three new people.
					</p>
					<p class="my-0">
						Week 5: Go to an event by himself, introduce himself to five new people, and follow up with one of them via email the next day to set up a one-on-one coffee meeting.
					</p>
					<h3>Mindfulness-Based Therapies</h3>
					<p>
						The final type of therapeutic approach I draw from is that of mindfulness-based therapies. Adding mindfulness into the mix of cognitive and behavioral approaches has gained wide acceptance and popularity over the past decade. 
					</p>
					<p>
						So what is mindfulness? Mindfulness is intentionally paying attention to the present moment with an attitude of openness and curiosity. There’s also a spirit of non-judgment to this process. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Learning mindfulness exercises can help bring your anxiety levels down so you can face your biggest confidence challenges. For now, here’s one of the simplest ways to start: focus on your breath.
					</p>
					<p>
						Notice the rhythm and sensation of your breathing. If you’re like 99.9 percent of people, your mind will stray. You’ll start thinking about your to-do list, wondering if you’re doing this right, thinking about what you’re going to have for lunch… All of that is completely normal and does not mean you’re not doing it properly.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you notice that your mind has strayed, gently bring your focus back to the breath. The key is gentle. You don’t say, “I’m so bad at this.” Just think, “Oh, there goes my mind wandering. That’s OK. I’ll just return my attention to the breath.”
					</p>
					<p>
						After a few minutes of practice, you’ll likely find that you’re a little calmer and less distracted.
					</p>
					<p>
						One benefit of mindfulness is that it’s a helpful way of disconnecting from the onslaught of negativity from your inner critic by reconnecting with the world around you. Although our minds will always tend to draw us into worries and what-ifs, it’s possible to train yourself to come back to Earth when you find yourself getting sucked into a ruminative spiral.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although the types of therapies I've described have some differences, they complement each other nicely. Therapists often combine strategies from these various approaches, which is what I've done in <em><strong>The Self-Confidence Workbook</strong></em>. I detail a wide range of strategies so you can tailor a plan that works for you.

						Difficult times can be depressing for anyone, but perhaps not for you. Your partner may feel unhappy about a precarious economic situation in your household, or about arguments with children, in-laws, or people at work. Others in your circle may be depressed by the events happening in the news. They may fear that their country’s leaders don’t care about them and are making poor decisions that will affect their ability to thrive. The reporting of a flood, hurricane, earthquake, or mass shooting may leave them feeling sad for the victims, but also personally vulnerable should such events hit home. It seems that all you talk about with these individuals is negatively tinged, and you leave these conversations wondering how to hold on to your own sense of optimism. New research suggests a surprising way to insulate your mood from being dragged down by the negativity of others, while at the same time helping them cope with their own negative emotions.
					</p>
					<p>
						According to Lucy McGuirk of the University of South Wales (Australia) and colleagues (2018), the route to happiness may involve, oddly enough, not thinking about happiness at all. She and her fellow researchers maintain that the social norm maintaining that happiness is the best way to live a fulfilling live has a downside: “Although placing value on happiness may have benefits when we feel happy, could it be that such cultural climates exacerbate our negative emotional experiences?” In other words, feeling pressured to be happy can itself create unhappiness, which in turn becomes detrimental to your mental health.
					</p>
					<p>
						This debunking of the happiness myth would have implications for your emotional state when the people around you are stressed, depressed, and angry. You feel that they’re taking away from your own good mood, which in turn causes you to feel resentful and worried. You worry, too, that there's something wrong with being unhappy in a culture that values bliss. Your lack of empathy for their feelings, moreover, can make their inner experiences even more painful. They want to be heard, but you don’t want to listen.
					</p>
					<p>
						The study conducted by McGuirk and her coauthors set out to test the problems that individuals experience when “happiness has become a cultural obsession” (p. 755). In the words of the authors, the overpromotion of happiness becomes self-defeating, because when people expect to be happy, they actually are not. Secondly, people can become overly and needlessly threatened by their negative mood states. They feel that they’re not managing to live up to “salient and desired social values” (p. 756), and therefore feel like failures.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Australian researcher and her fellow investigators believe that the key to avoiding the social pressure to feel happy all the time is to be able to distance yourself from this expectation. When you’re convinced that you have to be happy, because society tells you that you should be, don’t let yourself be dragged down by the tendency to ruminate or reflect on where you’re falling short. Avoiding rumination, then, should help you protect yourself from being brought down by your own negative states, or those of the people in your life. The authors tested this proposition in two studies examining the relationships among promotion of happiness, rumination on negative feelings, and well-being.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the first study, McGuirk et al. used an experimental design to manipulate happiness expectations among three groups of about 40 first-year psychology student participants. In one group, participants completed a negative mood-inducing task in a context emphasizing the importance of happiness in a room decorated with happiness books and motivational posters, with a highly cheerful experimenter in charge. The researchers led participants led to feel that they failed by giving them an impossible anagrams task (i.e., anagrams with no solution), and then telling them that they should have gotten more answers right. In the second group, participants completed the same stressful task in a room that had neutral decorations, and in the third, participants were in a neutrally decorated room, but were not led to feel they had failed, because they were told the task was difficult. The failure/no failure manipulation was followed by a rumination task, in which the research team had participants attempt to engage in a five-minute breathing task while being interrupted 12 times and asked to state what they were thinking. Higher rumination was indicated by the participants stating that they had negative thoughts, and higher failure-induced rumination by the participants stating that those negative thoughts were about the anagram task. Participants also completed a mood rating scale before and after the experiment.
					</p>
					<p>
						As the authors expected, participants were more likely to engage in anagram-related rumination when they were in the happy room and given the failure induction than when their failure was induced in a neutral room or when they were in a neutral room with no failure induction. In other words, being exposed to a situation in which happiness was dictated to be the social norm and then failing created an inner sense of turmoil, which participants could not successfully deflect. Furthermore, the tendency to engage in rumination focused on the anagram task was in turn correlated with the negative ratings that participants gave to their post-task ratings of mood.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second study used a correlational approach in which an online sample of 227 adults (average age 21 years old) rated the frequency and intensity with which they experienced four negative emotions (“When you feel depressed/sad/anxious/stressed, what is your experience of it like?”), social expectancies regarding negative emotions (e.g., “I think society accepts people who feel depressed or anxious”), the tendency to ruminate, and a standard measure of depressive symptoms. Other controls were also imposed to rule out the role of social anxiety in general, the desire to give socially acceptable responses, and personality.
					</p>
					<img class="myread-image img-fluid float-left mt-3 mr-3" src="assets/images/article3a.jpg" alt="Article 3a Image">
					<p>
						The results of the questionnaire study confirmed those of the experimental investigation, showing that people who felt it was important to seem happy and non-depressed due to social expectations were also more likely to engage in rumination when they experienced negative moods. These social expectations, the authors maintain, can shift such that if you feel happy when you’re expected to feel sad, you will feel that there’s something wrong with you. However, the pressure to be happy due to cultural expectations that people “should” be happy presents a social norm that has a stronger effect on people than the norm that people should be unhappy, angry, or stressed. In other words, when you’re unhappy in a culture that values happiness above all else, ruminating over your own negative inner state will create an ironic effect of increasing your unhappiness even more.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Returning to the question of how to maintain your happiness when others around you are not happy.</strong> In a culture that emphasizes happiness, the McGuirk et al. study suggests that you make a conscious effort to avoid ruminating on your own “deviant” inner state in relation to the people around you. You should also allow yourself to dip your toe into their unhappy waters without becoming overly preoccupied with whatever negative emotions you experience. The next step is for you to normalize the experience of the people who express their unhappiness. Show that you accept their feelings for what they are, rather than making them feel that there’s something wrong with them. The less you or anyone ruminates about negative feelings in an unproductive, mood-deflating way, the more fulfillment you, and those you care about, can experience.

					<h1>Five Self Care Ideas for the Modern Man</h1>
					<h4 class="my-0">Self care isn't just an activity; it's a mindset.</h4>
					<small class="d-block text-muted">Posted by Konstantin Lukin Ph.D. on Jun 02, 2018</small>
					<p>
						When you think of the term “self-care,” a woman in a bathrobe lighting candles and painting her toenails might come to mind. While this may seem amazing to some, most men would probably have different desires.
					</p>
					<p>
						The truth is, men need to work especially hard to take charge of caring for themselves. After all, is there anything more manly than being independent in your ability to care for yourself, not just physically, but emotionally and tangibly?
					</p>
					<p>
						We also need to change the way we think of “actualized manhood” in modern times. Instead of defining ourselves only in terms of work, productivity, and the overall “get” mentality, we must embrace other parts of ourselves that make us who we are and most importantly, make us happy.
					</p>
					<p>
						So without further delay, here are five ways for the modern man to practice self-care.
					</p>
					<h3>1. Make time for yourself.</h3>
					<p>
						The first step to proper self-care is making time for it. It’s easy to get caught up in your daily routine and fall victim to the idea that you don’t need to reserve any kind of special time for yourself when there are other more important things to do, such as providing for your family. But making self-care a priority is essential. This is not to say that you need to devote half of your day to a yoga class and sipping tea; self-care can be practiced virtually anywhere, depending on what type you are engaging in. For example, maybe you really enjoy music, and can listen to your favorite album on your daily commute. Alternatively, maybe you know you feel better physically and mentally when you take a few hours a week to get to the gym. Making time for yourself isn’t selfish, it is necessary to being at your best, which inherently seeps into every other aspect of your life.
					</p>
					<img class="myread-image img-fluid float-left mt-3 mr-3" src="assets/images/article2.jpg" alt="Article 2 Image">
					<h3>2. Engage with others.</h3>
					<p>
						Making time to engage with the people in your life that you care about, and that respect and love you is an important aspect of self-care. Maintaining meaningful relationships has been shown to positively influence mental health. Such relationships offer both the opportunity to share aspects of your own life, as well as escape from your day to day routine and do something out of the ordinary. Spending time maintaining and developing romantic relationships as well can increase both the vitality of the relationship, as well as your well-being, mood, and productivity.
					</p>
					<h3>3. Embrace health (both physical and mental).</h3>
					<p>
						Being cognizant of both your physical and mental health are pillars of self-care. From the basics—making yearly doctors’ appointments with both your primary care physician and specialists—to more daily tasks like checking in with yourself, your health needs to be a priority in your life. Psychologically, this might mean taking a few minutes before you go to sleep, or when you wake up in the morning, to take stock of how you’re feeling, and make plans to remedy any issues you may come upon. For example, are you feeling incredibly stressed out about work? Are you having a hard time turning of your brain to get a good night’s sleep? Are you engaging in unproductive worry? There are tangible steps to help each of these things, from mindfulness practices, to engaging with a mental health professional; staying on top of your mental as well as physical health can be nothing but beneficial in the long run.
					</p>
					<img class="myread-image img-fluid float-left mt-3 mr-3" src="assets/images/article2a.jpg" alt="Article 2a Image">
					<h3>4. Find passion and connection.</h3>
					<p>
						Identifying and engaging with things that interest or spark passion in your life is another important aspect of self-care. For example, is there a particular magazine or newspaper that you enjoy reading articles from? Do you love watching professional soccer? Or is nature more what gets you going? Making time to engage in these activities, whatever they may be, is important to build into your schedule, even if in small increments. Knowing what brings you joy, and being proactive about practicing or engaging with these aspects of your life has been shown to increase well-being.
					</p>
					<h3>5. Know your burnout signs.</h3>
					<p>
						Taking note of when you are not feeling yourself can help you decide when self-care may be especially beneficial to avoiding burn out, or reaching a mental or physical state that would take you some time to recover from. For example, did you just get irrationally angry at someone on the subway who brushed against your arm? Or do you feel completely wiped out by the end of the day to the point that you can’t even speak to your wife or enjoy spending time with your children? Little signs like this, whether it be a short temper or exhaustion, that will of course be different for everyone, can help identify when it may be time for either a mental health day, or for those whose schedules do not allow that luxury, a half hour or so to yourself, doing something that you know helps you “reset.” 
					</p>
					<p>
						Self-care isn’t just an activity you can build into your daily life. It’s a mindset that we all should embody, involving putting ourselves first, and checking in with ourselves on a regular basis to help put our best foot forward in everything we do.

					<h1>4 Ways Nature Can Help You Build Mental Strength</h1>
					<h4 class="my-0">The great outdoors offers many opportunities to build mental muscle.</h4>

					<p>
						Not all muscle is built in the gym—especially when it comes to mental muscle. And the best news is, becoming mentally stronger doesn't necessarily involve putting yourself through a grueling mental workout.
					</p>
					<p>
						While there are many exercises you can do every day to build mental strength, one of the easiest things you can do is to spend time in nature. Whether you go for a walk in the woods or you eat a picnic in a park, time in nature could be key to building a strong mind.
					</p>
					<h3>1. Spending Time in Nature Improves Your Mental Health</h3>
					<p>
						Many studies have found that the great outdoors can boost your happiness. But a 2015 study conducted by researchers at Stanford found that a walk in the woods can lower your risk of depression.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other research has found that people living in rural areas have a 20 percent lower risk of anxiety and a 40 percent lower risk of mood disorders compared to people living in urban areas. Perhaps the green spaces in the country have something to do with that.
					</p>
					<h3>2. Walking in Green Space Reduces Mental Fatigue</h3>
					<p>
						A 2013 study published in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> found that walking a half-mile through a park reduces brain fatigue. Scientists have known for some time that the human brain's ability to stay focused is limited and the constant noise and demands of living in the city lead to mental fatigue.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nature, however, offers a calming effect and requires less mental attention than busy urban streets. So a quick walk in the park on your lunch break or stroll through a botanical garden on the weekend could offer the mental rejuvenation you need to stay focused when you're tackling a tough project.
					</p>
					<h3>3. Looking at Landscapes Reduces Emotional and Physical Pain</h3>
					<p>
						If you live in an urban area and you don't have any parks close by, you're not out of out of luck. You may be able to reap a few benefits from nature by simply looking at landscape pictures.
					</p>
					<p>
						Researchers discovered that hospital spaces with a window overlooking green space heal faster than other patients. Since not everyone can have a window with a view, researchers tested what happens when patients looked at pictures of landscapes. They discovered looking at pictures of nature reduced pain and decreased anxiety.
					</p>
					<h3>4. Watching the Ocean Reduces Stress</h3>
					<p>
						If you're fortunate to live near the coast, spend time watching the ocean. A 2016 study published in <em>Health & Place</em>, found that spending time on the ocean reduces the likelihood of developing depression and anxiety.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to increasing your sense of inner calm, the water has also been found to boost creativity. So you may want to spring for the hotel room with an ocean view on your next vacation.
					</p>
					<h3>Build Your Mental Muscle</h3>
					<p>
						Everyone has the ability to develop more mental muscle. And while becoming stronger sometimes involves giving up the bad mental habits that hold you back, you can also build strength through the simple everyday choices you make.
					</p>
					<p>
						So get outside and spend a little time in nature. Not only could it be good for your physical health, but it's also an easy way to improve your psychological well-being.
