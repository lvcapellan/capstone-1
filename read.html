				<h1>4 Proven Approaches to Increase Your Confidence Level</h1>
				<h4 class="my-0">Stick with science-based therapies to improve your self-confidence.</h4>
				<small class="d-block">Posted by Barbara Markway Ph.D. on Oct 23, 2018</small>
				<img class="myread-image img-fluid float-left mt-3 mr-3" src="assets/images/article4.jpg" alt="Article 4 Image">
				<p>
					Have you ever said to yourself, “I don’t feel confident, so I couldn’t possibly… [insert desired goal here].” Not many of us are taught how confidence truly works. We get it backwards. We believe we have to wait until we feel confident before we can act confidently.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my new book, <em><strong>The Self-Confidence Workbook: A Guide to Overcoming Self-Doubt and Improving Self-Esteem</strong></em>, I show you the truth about self-confidence: what it is, where it come from, and how to master the rules of the confidence game. The book is based on evidence-based therapies, meaning they’ve been shown in rigorous research studies to work. Let’s look at each one and show how it relates to self-confidence. 
				</p>
				<h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
				<p>
					If you’ve read any self-help books or articles, you’ve likely heard of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), as it’s one of the most widely-used types of treatment for depression, anxiety, and many other conditions. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Here’s one principle of CBT in action. Imagine you’re walking down the street and you see someone on the other side walking toward you. You get a little closer and recognize the person as someone you know from your Zumba class. You look up, smile, wave and shout “hi.” The other person keeps walking and doesn’t acknowledge you. There are many ways you could interpret this situation. What would you say to yourself? 
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					A.	She must not like me. I’m such a loser.
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					B.	She must not have seen me.
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					C.	She’s so stuck up. I can’t believe she didn’t say hi.		
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, imagine how you’d feel in each case. 
				</p>				
				<p>
					If you thought to yourself, “She must not like me,” you’d likely feel sad, embarrassed, or something along those lines. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If you thought to yourself, “She must not have seen me,” you’d likely feel pretty neutral, or maybe simply a little disappointed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If you answered C, you might feel angry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice that the event is the same. The only thing that has changed is your interpretation of the situation, or what you’re saying to yourself. The principle behind CBT is that self-talk matters.
				</p>
				<p>
					So what does this have to do with confidence? Low self-confidence is often based upon unhelpful or untrue interpretations of a situation. If you believe your Zumba classmate didn’t wave at you because you’re a loser, you’re much less likely to risk saying hi or starting a conversation with her in the future. That’s why CBT, a set of methods to identify such thoughts and reframe them, is often so useful in building self-assurance. 
				</p>
				<h3>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h3>
				<p>
					Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, pronounced like the word “act”) was developed in 1986 by Steven C. Hayes, a professor in the psychology department at the University of Nevada. Hayes took a somewhat controversial view, at least in terms of mainstream psychology at the time, asserting that suffering is an inevitable and essential part of being human. He argued that accepting this suffering, rather than running from it, was a more effective way to build a meaningful life.
				</p>
				<p>
					He also took a different view of thoughts than his CBT colleagues. Recall that in CBT you aim to notice your negative thoughts so that you can replace them with more helpful ones. ACT doesn’t place as much emphasis on the content of your thoughts. At the heart of ACT is the idea that you can learn to live with even unpleasant thoughts, as long as you don’t give them power over your actions. 
				</p>
				<p>
					ACT teaches you not to avoid worry, fear, or doubt, because negative feelings are just a natural part of life. Struggling against your anxiety can often make it worse.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you find yourself thinking, “I can’t do this,” or “This is going to be a disaster,” you can learn to notice the thought and let it pass you by without deciding it’s the gospel truth. Detaching from your negative thoughts helps prevent rumination, which is linked to anxiety and depression, and lessens the urge to run from discomfort by indulging in harmful behaviors such as binge-drinking or overeating.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may not be able to evict your inner critic from your mind, but you can learn to tune out its relentless negativity and move forward — or “act” — with confidence.
				</p>
				<h3>Exposure Therapy</h3>
				<p>
					Exposure therapy sometimes falls under the umbrella of CBT, as it is a behavioral therapy aimed at helping people overcome anxiety and fear. This type of therapy helps people identify thoughts and situations that trigger the most fear and then gently exposes sufferers to them. It’s been shown to help people overcome spider phobias to stage fright — and it can help you develop your confidence, too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Don’t worry — you don’t have to dive into the deep end and learn to swim! Research shows that being forced to face a big fear all at once only leaves you traumatized, swearing you’ll never try again. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Exposure therapy is more like dipping your toes in the water. You start with a tiny first step that scares you just a little bit, getting used to the fear and realizing you’re capable of handling it. Then you build up gradually to bigger and bigger steps, until you’re finally swimming in the pool.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some exposure therapy is done in real life. For example, I took a client who was afraid of heights to a nearby building for several sessions, working our way up the floors until she was comfortable standing close to a railing many stories up. Other times, imagining the situation is enough to practice grappling with the fear.
				</p>
				<p>
					The key is repetition: you can’t try facing your fear once and then wait a year and try again. Here’s an example of how Kurt, who feels he doesn’t have the confidence to attend networking events in his industry, might use exposure therapy to overcome that fear.
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					Week 1: Go to a networking event with someone he already knows and stay just 30 minutes.
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					Week 2: Go to an event with someone he knows and introduce himself to at least one new person.	
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					Week 3: Go to an event with someone he knows and introduce himself to three new people.
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					Week 4: Go to an event by himself, greet everyone he’s met before, and introduce himself to three new people.
				</p>
				<p class="my-0">
					Week 5: Go to an event by himself, introduce himself to five new people, and follow up with one of them via email the next day to set up a one-on-one coffee meeting.
				</p>
				<h3>Mindfulness-Based Therapies</h3>
				<p>
					The final type of therapeutic approach I draw from is that of mindfulness-based therapies. Adding mindfulness into the mix of cognitive and behavioral approaches has gained wide acceptance and popularity over the past decade. 
				</p>
				<p>
					So what is mindfulness? Mindfulness is intentionally paying attention to the present moment with an attitude of openness and curiosity. There’s also a spirit of non-judgment to this process. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Learning mindfulness exercises can help bring your anxiety levels down so you can face your biggest confidence challenges. For now, here’s one of the simplest ways to start: focus on your breath.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice the rhythm and sensation of your breathing. If you’re like 99.9 percent of people, your mind will stray. You’ll start thinking about your to-do list, wondering if you’re doing this right, thinking about what you’re going to have for lunch… All of that is completely normal and does not mean you’re not doing it properly.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you notice that your mind has strayed, gently bring your focus back to the breath. The key is gentle. You don’t say, “I’m so bad at this.” Just think, “Oh, there goes my mind wandering. That’s OK. I’ll just return my attention to the breath.”
				</p>
				<p>
					After a few minutes of practice, you’ll likely find that you’re a little calmer and less distracted.
				</p>
				<p>
					One benefit of mindfulness is that it’s a helpful way of disconnecting from the onslaught of negativity from your inner critic by reconnecting with the world around you. Although our minds will always tend to draw us into worries and what-ifs, it’s possible to train yourself to come back to Earth when you find yourself getting sucked into a ruminative spiral.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although the types of therapies I've described have some differences, they complement each other nicely. Therapists often combine strategies from these various approaches, which is what I've done in <em><strong>The Self-Confidence Workbook</strong></em>. I detail a wide range of strategies so you can tailor a plan that works for you.

				<h1>How to Be Happy When the People Around You Are Not</h1>
				<h4 class="my-0">New study shows how to overcome the effects other people have on your happiness.</h4>
				<small class="d-block">Posted by Susan Krauss Whitbourne Ph.D. on Sep 29, 2018</small>
				<img class="myread-image img-fluid float-left mt-3 mr-3" src="assets/images/article3.jpg" alt="Article 3 Image">
				<p>
					Difficult times can be depressing for anyone, but perhaps not for you. Your partner may feel unhappy about a precarious economic situation in your household, or about arguments with children, in-laws, or people at work. Others in your circle may be depressed by the events happening in the news. They may fear that their country’s leaders don’t care about them and are making poor decisions that will affect their ability to thrive. The reporting of a flood, hurricane, earthquake, or mass shooting may leave them feeling sad for the victims, but also personally vulnerable should such events hit home. It seems that all you talk about with these individuals is negatively tinged, and you leave these conversations wondering how to hold on to your own sense of optimism. New research suggests a surprising way to insulate your mood from being dragged down by the negativity of others, while at the same time helping them cope with their own negative emotions.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Lucy McGuirk of the University of South Wales (Australia) and colleagues (2018), the route to happiness may involve, oddly enough, not thinking about happiness at all. She and her fellow researchers maintain that the social norm maintaining that happiness is the best way to live a fulfilling live has a downside: “Although placing value on happiness may have benefits when we feel happy, could it be that such cultural climates exacerbate our negative emotional experiences?” In other words, feeling pressured to be happy can itself create unhappiness, which in turn becomes detrimental to your mental health.
				</p>
				<p>
					This debunking of the happiness myth would have implications for your emotional state when the people around you are stressed, depressed, and angry. You feel that they’re taking away from your own good mood, which in turn causes you to feel resentful and worried. You worry, too, that there's something wrong with being unhappy in a culture that values bliss. Your lack of empathy for their feelings, moreover, can make their inner experiences even more painful. They want to be heard, but you don’t want to listen.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study conducted by McGuirk and her coauthors set out to test the problems that individuals experience when “happiness has become a cultural obsession” (p. 755). In the words of the authors, the overpromotion of happiness becomes self-defeating, because when people expect to be happy, they actually are not. Secondly, people can become overly and needlessly threatened by their negative mood states. They feel that they’re not managing to live up to “salient and desired social values” (p. 756), and therefore feel like failures.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Australian researcher and her fellow investigators believe that the key to avoiding the social pressure to feel happy all the time is to be able to distance yourself from this expectation. When you’re convinced that you have to be happy, because society tells you that you should be, don’t let yourself be dragged down by the tendency to ruminate or reflect on where you’re falling short. Avoiding rumination, then, should help you protect yourself from being brought down by your own negative states, or those of the people in your life. The authors tested this proposition in two studies examining the relationships among promotion of happiness, rumination on negative feelings, and well-being.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the first study, McGuirk et al. used an experimental design to manipulate happiness expectations among three groups of about 40 first-year psychology student participants. In one group, participants completed a negative mood-inducing task in a context emphasizing the importance of happiness in a room decorated with happiness books and motivational posters, with a highly cheerful experimenter in charge. The researchers led participants led to feel that they failed by giving them an impossible anagrams task (i.e., anagrams with no solution), and then telling them that they should have gotten more answers right. In the second group, participants completed the same stressful task in a room that had neutral decorations, and in the third, participants were in a neutrally decorated room, but were not led to feel they had failed, because they were told the task was difficult. The failure/no failure manipulation was followed by a rumination task, in which the research team had participants attempt to engage in a five-minute breathing task while being interrupted 12 times and asked to state what they were thinking. Higher rumination was indicated by the participants stating that they had negative thoughts, and higher failure-induced rumination by the participants stating that those negative thoughts were about the anagram task. Participants also completed a mood rating scale before and after the experiment.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the authors expected, participants were more likely to engage in anagram-related rumination when they were in the happy room and given the failure induction than when their failure was induced in a neutral room or when they were in a neutral room with no failure induction. In other words, being exposed to a situation in which happiness was dictated to be the social norm and then failing created an inner sense of turmoil, which participants could not successfully deflect. Furthermore, the tendency to engage in rumination focused on the anagram task was in turn correlated with the negative ratings that participants gave to their post-task ratings of mood.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second study used a correlational approach in which an online sample of 227 adults (average age 21 years old) rated the frequency and intensity with which they experienced four negative emotions (“When you feel depressed/sad/anxious/stressed, what is your experience of it like?”), social expectancies regarding negative emotions (e.g., “I think society accepts people who feel depressed or anxious”), the tendency to ruminate, and a standard measure of depressive symptoms. Other controls were also imposed to rule out the role of social anxiety in general, the desire to give socially acceptable responses, and personality.
				</p>
				<p>
					The results of the questionnaire study confirmed those of the experimental investigation, showing that people who felt it was important to seem happy and non-depressed due to social expectations were also more likely to engage in rumination when they experienced negative moods. These social expectations, the authors maintain, can shift such that if you feel happy when you’re expected to feel sad, you will feel that there’s something wrong with you. However, the pressure to be happy due to cultural expectations that people “should” be happy presents a social norm that has a stronger effect on people than the norm that people should be unhappy, angry, or stressed. In other words, when you’re unhappy in a culture that values happiness above all else, ruminating over your own negative inner state will create an ironic effect of increasing your unhappiness even more.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Returning to the question of how to maintain your happiness when others around you are not happy.</strong> In a culture that emphasizes happiness, the McGuirk et al. study suggests that you make a conscious effort to avoid ruminating on your own “deviant” inner state in relation to the people around you. You should also allow yourself to dip your toe into their unhappy waters without becoming overly preoccupied with whatever negative emotions you experience. The next step is for you to normalize the experience of the people who express their unhappiness. Show that you accept their feelings for what they are, rather than making them feel that there’s something wrong with them. The less you or anyone ruminates about negative feelings in an unproductive, mood-deflating way, the more fulfillment you, and those you care about, can experience.
